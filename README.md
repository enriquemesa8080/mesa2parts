# mesa2parts
A tool that divides a file into multiple parts, and later reassemble them into a single one. 

Hello. My name is Enrique Mesa. I am a programmer who decided to open source some projects. My main reason behind them is that i will no longer mantain them, and they can get lost in my computer. Please, any user can feel free to modify this project and the others that i have released in this week and more. 

This project has done the following.

Divide a file in n parts. The algorithm works fine, it takes the file and divide into many files as needed as parts.

The project has the following current bugs or project decisitions problems.

When i divide a file into , e.g, five parts, it returns me back six parts. There is a problem of decision because the software left a remainder, and remainder doesn't fit in any small piece of package, and then the program assume to let the remainder apart. It can be written in the last part, as part of solution.

TO-DO. There is no reassemble function. It could be easy to write, but it takes me time, and i will no longer support the software, not as a standalone. 

The software could be supported in a future as part of a broad tool, not as a single standalone.
